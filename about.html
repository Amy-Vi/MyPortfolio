        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>I'm a junior front-end developer with a strong drive 
            to learn and grow in the field. Based in Tallinn, Estonia, 
            I'm currently pursuing my studies at Tallinn University. 
            I'm 23 years old and bring a positive and enthusiastic attitude 
            to every project. I believe in the importance of clear communication 
            and teamwork, and I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and skillset.
            I'm looking to gain experience in a collaborative environment where I can 
            contribute to meaningful projects and continue to develop my skills as a 
            front-end developer. I'm particularly interested in [mention a specific 
            area of interest, e.g., building web applications, working with e-commerce
             platforms].</p>
